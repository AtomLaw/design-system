notes: |
  We're using <a href="https://github.com/google/material-design-icons" target="_blank">Material Icons</a> for icons across the Design System. The Design System includes all the necessary styles to use Material Icons, there's some <a href="https://github.com/JDRF/design-system#using-design-system" target="_blank">additional setup</a> required to use them.

  It is recommended to make use of the <code class="language-markup">.ds-sr-only</code> class to include screen-reader text that is visually hidden, but can help identify icons to screen reader users.

  For more info on how to use Material Icons, review <a href="http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web" target="_blank">Google's documentation</a>.
