# JDRF Design System

# Local Development
Running locally, all files can be access via their full path, but it's recommended to serve them with the below command and access at http://localhost:3000
````
gulp serve
````

If you are developing the master branch, it's recommended that you run the below command instead. This will add a dependency on the master branch dist files and allow local development.
````
gulp serve-local
````
